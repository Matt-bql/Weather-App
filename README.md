Key points: 
  * Create button that, when clicked, requests geo location data, if permission granted grab that geo data and pass it into
    the run() method and grab weather data that is relevant to that location. If permission not granted we default the location to 
    Brentwood, TN.
  If I had more time:
    * make elements responsive to screen size
    * make the code more cohesive and ahere more to functional paradigm. - my preference
    * paint a better story for the weather data being displayed (better styling)
